# Photogrammetry II: Relative Orientation Practice

This folder contains a MATLAB/Octave code developed in 2017 for the **Photogrammetry and Transformation Systems** (Photogrammetry II) course at the **University of Isfahan**. It was created as part of a project to practice implementing a basic **relative orientation** of images, a foundational concept in photogrammetry.

## About Relative Orientation

Relative orientation refers to the process of determining the relative position and orientation of two overlapping images, enabling 3D reconstruction from stereo images. For more information, you can read [this overview of relative orientation](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog892/node/647).

## Project Overview

- **Language**: MATLAB, also compatible with Octave.
- **Function**: Computes the relative orientation of stereo images.
- **Purpose**: Educational and practice-based, not intended for advanced applications.
- **Created**: 2017

## Demonstrations

Here are some examples of the results produced by this code:

| Orientation Type           | Demo                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Both-Side Orientation**   | ![Both-Side Orientation](Relative_Orientation/docs/Both-Side.gif) |
| **Left-Side Orientation**   | ![Left-Side Orientation](Relative_Orientation/docs/Left-side.gif) |
| **Right-Side Orientation**  | ![Right-Side Orientation](Relative_Orientation/docs/Right-Side.gif) |

## Note
This code is for learning purposes and may not include advanced photogrammetry functionality.

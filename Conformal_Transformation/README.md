# Photogrammetry II: Conformal Transformation Practice

This repository contains MATLAB/Octave code developed in 2017 for the **Photogrammetry II** course at the **University of Isfahan** during my bachelorâ€™s studies. The code demonstrates a **conformal transformation** from a pixel coordinate system to a photogrammetric coordinate system, a key concept in photogrammetry.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: MATLAB/Octave
- **Function**: Performs a conformal transformation to map image (pixel) coordinates to the photogrammetric coordinate system.

## Note

This code was created as a simple practice exercise and does not implement advanced photogrammetry functions.
